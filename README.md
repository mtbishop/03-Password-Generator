# This is my first Java Script project for the full stack boot camp.

## The requirements are:

When you click the button to generate a password.

You will be presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.

Then you select which criteria to include in the password which includes being prompted for the length of the password with at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.

Then you are prompted for character types to include in the password, you choose between lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.

When you answer each prompt input it should be validated and at least one character type should be included.

When all prompts are answered a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.

When the password is generated, the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
